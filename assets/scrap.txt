known issue or goal (either ignored or being worked on): 
ls file1 file2 dir1 dir2: will group files and dirs separately, but will not print out in a sorted order
disable ctrl -a inside the the div

```testing log (manual) for cd/ls
ls /home/sethuaung/code --> good
ls /home/sethuaung/.. --> good
ls ~/../../home/felixent/../sethuaung/code/../../felixent/ex --> good
ls /home/sethuaung/./../felixent --> good
ls ~/../../bin/../home/felixent/././ex/../ --> ex MKNQ --> good

cd /
cd ../bin/../home/../bin/../bin/../home/sethuaung/../felixent/../.. should take you to '/' --> good

cd /home 
cd ../bin/../home/../bin/../bin/../home/sethuaung/../felixent/../.. should take you to '/' --> good

cd ~
cd ../bin/../home/../bin/../bin/../home/sethuaung/../felixent/../.. should give No such file/dir error (~~bad~~ good, false alarm)
cd: ../bin/../home/../bin/../bin/../home/sethuaung/../felixent/../../felixent: Permission denied --> good


in actual Ubuntu, when you type `cd ../bin/..`, it will check the existence of each file as it traverses
meaning, it will go back to parent directory .. and check if 'bin' is there, and return an error if not
however, in my simulator, to simplify the pathing input, I decided to make a function that would read the path as a whole
and return a new path that is relative to the current working directory (if path starts with . or ..)
For example, if pwd is '/home/user', typing '../bin/..' would be read as '/home/user/../bin/..' which is equivalent to '/home', and so it will change the pwd to '/home'.
In actual Ubuntu, it will go to .. from '/home/user' which is now '/home/', check for 'bin', and if 'bin' is not there, it will return an error saying File not found.

working on SUDO (done)

change user (su - username)
add user (sudo adduser username)
remove user

rmdir

chmod

whoami sethuaung
pwd /home/felixent/ex
ls ../ex --> should return Permission denied but mine doesnt
